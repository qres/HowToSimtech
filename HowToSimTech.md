Mathematical formulas can either be written using the LaTeX code or with the various shortcuts (e.g `Alt-M G A` for alpha (read "alt math Greek alpha"), `Alt-M I` for integrals).

 * You can write raw LaTeX via `ctrl-L` for features that are not natively supported by LyX.

</details>

# Debugging -- C, C++, ...

<details><summary>gdb</summary>

 * You can modify the _startup script_ `~/.gdbinit`. There exists various init files to support _colored output_ ([copy this file in your init file](https://github.com/RAttab/dotfiles/blob/master/colors.gdb)) and many other other features.
 * If you want to debug a program wich takes _command line arguments_ you can pass them like `gdb --args program param1 param2`.
 * You can print the first three elements of _arrays_ using `p *ptr@3`. If you have a 3x2 matrix you can also use `p *ptr@3@2` which will give a clearer structure to the output than `p *ptr@6`.

</details>

<details><summary>gdbgui <a href="https://gdbgui.com/screenshots.html">↗</a></summary>
"Browser-based debugger for C, C++, go, rust, and more"
</details>

<details><summary>Valgrind</summary>

Useful to find difficult _memory bugs_ when gdb doesn't catch them or doesn't give any useful information. Examples are _double free_-bugs, bugs which corrupted the allocator meta data (in this case you might get an error the next time you try to allocate any new memory) or reading _uninitialized memory_.

 * You can use the flag `valgrind --track-origins=yes` to make valgrind track and report where you allocated uninitialized memory.
 * Besides memory checks with the default `--tool=memcheck` there also exist many other tools. E.g. `--tool=cachegrind`, which compute _cache misses_ for the instruction cache and memory cache.
 * Warning: valgrind will make your program run really slow.

</details>

# Profiling -- C, C++, ...

<details><summary>perf</summary>
</details>

<details><summary>Flamegraph <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">↗</a></summary>

Nice way to [visualize](http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpuflamegraphs.html) the results of `perf`.

 * `perf script | ~/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | ~/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg` creates an interactive svg image from the perf script.
 * You can also mix it with some `grep`, `sed`, oder `c++filt`.
 * There also exists a [module](https://github.com/evanhempel/python-flamegraph) for python.

</details>

<details><summary>Valgrind</summary>

 * For measuring _cache misses_. See the valgrind section in 'Debugging'

</details>

<details><summary>c++filt</summary>
Demangles C++ names to make them more readable. Nice in combination with profiler output or flamegraphs.
</details>

# Debugging -- Cuda

<details><summary>cuda-gdb</summary>

Gdb with cuda extension. You can also set _breakpoints in kernels_ and switch between threads to inspect the variables.

 * You can also create an init file `~/cuda-gdbinit`. Just use the same file as for `gdb` if you want colored backtraces.
 * To break on API errors like failed kernel launches or other error codes use `set cuda api_failures stop`.
 * To check for _invalid memory addresses_, you can use `set cuda memcheck on` to enable something like `valgrind --tool=memcheck` for cuda. Warning: This makes your program much slower.
 * TODO: problem with breakpoints on gpu connected to display.

</details>

# Profiling -- Cuda

<details><summary>nvprof</summary>

Command line profiler for Cuda programs. You can also generate a file, which can be imported to `nvvp` using `--analysis-metrics -o file`. This helps with profiling a remote program.

 * You can output the profiling in CSV format with a common time unit using `--csv -u us`.
 * Profiling can be limited to specific kernels using `--kernels my_kernel`, which applies to following `--analysis-metrics`, `--events` or `--metrics` options.
 * You can control the GPUs visible to your program by setting the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. Example: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,2` masks out GPU 1. Run `nvidia-smi` to get the number of each GPU.

</details>

# Plotting

<details><summary>matplotlib</summary>
Python library for plotting.
</details>

<details><summary>gnuplot</summary>

Language especially for plotting. Can export to many formats including png, svg, latex.

 * You can use the init file `.gnuplot` to run code or set settings startup
 * Can fit arbitrary parameters to compute a function that approximates the data points using `fit`.
 * You can also plot data using the output of shell commands: `plot '< python gen_data.py'` or `plot '< sed -n "s/^# //p" file'` or even with pipes `plot '< cat data/* | sed -n "s#re=\(.*\)#\1#p"'`

</details>

<details><summary>PGFPlots</summary>

Handy LaTeX package to create plots directly in LaTeX. Can plot data in CSV or gnuplot format. Supports diagrams, graphs, box plots, 3d plots and many more.

 * There are also higher level features as loops and random numbers.
 * Becomes slow for many plots. You can avoid the recomputation of the plots by compiling them in another document into an PDF and include it with `\includegraphics`. This is done automatically if you use `\usepgfplotslibrary{external}` and `\tikzexternalize[prefix=TikzPictures/]` in your preamble.
 * You can use gnuplot to plot your data.

</details>

<details><summary>ZSH</summary>

Shell with useful autocompletion and many other features.

 * To get started, [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) is good to manage your zsh configuration.

</details>

# Job Scheduler

<details><summary>Slurm</summary>

Job manager.

 * `srun --ntasks=42 script.sh` allocates 42 tasks and runs the job in your terminal. The default is one task per node.
 * `srun --ntasks=42 --pty bash` allocates 42 tasks and starts an interactive session. Use `exit` to exit the interactive session.
 * `sbatch --ntasks=1 script.sh` allocates and runs script. script gets _copied_ to an other location and is executed, once there are enough resources available. In contrast to `srun` the script is _only_ run on the first node! You can use `srun` inside the batch script.
 * `squeue` to see the current jobs in the job queue.
 * `scancel` to kill your jobs or revoke them from the queue.
 * `salloc --ntasks=42` allocate recources for yourself, but stay on login node. If you want to use the recources use `srun` afterwards. Useful if one job contains multiple `srun` commands, as you don't have to reallocate recources for each job. Use `exit` to exit the allocation.
 * Use `--job-name="Bob"` to give your job a descriptive name.
 * Use `--time=8:00:00` to set the upper limit for the runtime of your program.
 * If you run a batch script with `srun` or `sbatch` you can also define the command line parameters inside the script using `#SBATCH --ntasks=42`.

```bash
srun -n4 hostname # runs hostname on four nodes
# prints allocated compute nodes

salloc -n4 # allocate four nodes
  hostname
  # print the current login node
  srun hostname # runs hostname on all allocated nodes
  # prints allocated compute nodes
  srun -n2 hostname # runs hostname on two of the allocated nodes
  # prints allocated compute nodes
exit

echo -e '#!/usr/bin/env bash\nhostname' > script.sh
sbatch -n4 script.sh # submits the script
# returns immediately and stores the output of the job into a file
# output file contains only the host name for the first node

echo -e '#!/usr/bin/env bash\nsrun hostname' > script.sh
sbatch -n4 script.sh # submits a script to run hostname on four nodes
# returns immediately and stores the output of the job into a file
# output file contains the host names for all compute nodes

echo -e '#!/usr/bin/env bash\n#SBATCH -n4\n#SBATCH --output myoutfile\nsrun hostname' > script.sh
sbatch script.sh
# prints the host name of all four allocated nodes into `myoutfile`
```

Some more advanced stuff:

 * Slurm sets various environment variables which you can use in your scripts.
 * You can queue multiple versions of one `sbatch` job using [task arrays](https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html) with `--array=0-17`. You can use the environment variable `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` in your scripts to find out which array task you are executing.

```
# program we want to run with different parameters
echo "sleep 3;echo $1" > smartprogram.sh
# batch script which uses the array id to change the parameters
echo -e '#!/usr/bin/env bash\nsrun bash smartprogram.sh $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID' > script.sh
# run a program multiple times
sbatch -n1 --array=3-5 script.sh
# outputs the numbers 3,4 and 5 in three output files
```
